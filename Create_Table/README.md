# INTRO
In this project, I created a friends table and add/delete data from it. 

- 1.Create a table named friends with three columns:<br>
<br>
id that stores INTEGER<br>
name that stores TEXT<br>
birthday that stores DATE<br>
<br>

#### 2.Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.<br>
<br>
Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.<br>
<br>

#### 3.Let’s make sure that Ororo has been added to the database:<br>

```
SELECT * 
FROM friends;

```


Check for two things:<br>

Is friends table created?<br>
Is Ororo Munroe added to it?<br>
<br>

#### 4.Let’s move on!<br>


Add two of your friends to the table.<br>

Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.<br>
<br>

#### 5.Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”.<br>

Update her record in friends.<br>
<br>

#### 6.Add a new column named email.<br>

#### 7.Update the email address for everyone in your table.<br>

Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.<br>

#### 8.Wait, Storm is fictional…<br>

Remove her from friends.<br>
