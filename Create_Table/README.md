# INTRO
- In this project, I created a friends table and add/delete data from it. 

### 1.Create a table named friends with three columns:<br>

id that stores INTEGER<br>
name that stores TEXT<br>
birthday that stores DATE<br>

### 2.Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends.<br>
<br>
Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.<br>
<br>

### 3.Let’s make sure that Ororo has been added to the database:<br>

```
SELECT * 
FROM friends;
```
Check for two things:<br>

Is friends table created?<br>
Is Ororo Munroe added to it?<br>

### 4.Let’s move on!

Add two of your friends to the table.<br>

Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.<br>

### 5.Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”.

Update her record in friends.<br>

### 6.Add a new column named email.

### 7.Update the email address for everyone in your table.

Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.<br>

### 8.Wait, Storm is fictional…

Remove her from friends.<br>
